# LGBTeens Reddit Dataset


Paper: [The Colorful Future of LLMs: Evaluating and Improving LLMs as Emotional Supporters for Queer Youth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11886)


This repository contains a dataset of posts from the [LGBTeens](https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTeens/) subreddit, along with top-rated human responses and responses generated by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). The dataset was created to evaluate the quality of LLM responses in providing emotional support to queer youth. In collaboration with experts, we developed a 10-question annotation scheme to judge the quality of LLM responses along various important dimensions.


## Ethical Considerations


While the posts on Reddit are public, they are sensitive in nature, and the authors did not consent to their inclusion in an AI dataset. Therefore, if you plan to use this dataset, please contact us first to discuss appropriate usage and ethical considerations.
